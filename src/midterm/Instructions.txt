    Polygon Class
        Define all methods according to default practice

    Triangle Class - Round all decimals to two places
        get_area() - return the area of the triangle ((width*height)/2)
        get_perimeter() - return the perimeter of the triangle (math.sqrt(width**2 + height**2) + width + height)
        equal_to() - return True if height and width are the same
        All other methods are according to default practice
        You'll need to import the math packages

    Rectangle Class - Round all decimals to two places
        get_area() - return the area of the rectangle (width * length)
        get_perimeter() - return the perimeter of the rectangle (2 * width + 2 * length)
        equal_to() - return True if width and length are equal
        All other methods are according to default practice
        You'll need to import the math packages
    Driver
