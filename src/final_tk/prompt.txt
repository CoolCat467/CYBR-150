MAIN PROMPT:
    You have been tasked with helping grab login credentials
for your new company. Please create a small tkinter GUI that presents a
user fields to enter a username and password and a button to login. You
must add labels and organize the widgets for usability. When clicked,
the button will print out the username and the password to the console.
Be sure the password is obscured when entering it into the GUI!

BONUS (+5):
    If the password is correct, tell the user they are a "New
User" and allow them to enter First, Middle, Last, and Email into a new
window. Add a Signup button that displays their information to the
console and prints "Welcome {first}!" somewhere in the tkinter window.
